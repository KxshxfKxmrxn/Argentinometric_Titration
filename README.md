# Interactive Argentometric Method with Apparatus Animation

## Description
This project is an interactive simulation of the argentometric titration method using Pygame. It visually demonstrates the titration process by allowing users to add silver nitrate (AgNO3) to a chloride-containing sample and observe color changes. The simulation calculates chloride concentration in both mol/L and ppm while tracking scores and levels.

## Features
- Click to add AgNO3 to the water sample.
- Dynamic color change based on chloride concentration.
- Real-time calculations of chloride concentration (mol/L and ppm).
- Score and level tracking.
- Reset button to restart the experiment.

## Installation

os.system("git clone <repository-url>")
os.chdir("argentometric-titration-simulation")
os.system("pip install -r requirements.txt")

## Usage
import os
os.system("python argentometric_titration.py")

## Dependencies
