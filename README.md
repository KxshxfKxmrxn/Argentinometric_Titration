## 📌 Overview  

This project is an *interactive simulator* built using *Pygame* that visually demonstrates the *argentometric titration* method. The user can add silver nitrate (*AgNO₃) to a water sample containing chloride ions and observe the **color changes* in the beaker as the titration progresses. The simulation calculates and displays the chloride concentration in *mol/L* and *ppm (parts per million)*, making it a great educational tool for chemistry students and enthusiasts.  

## ✨ Features  

✔ *Graphical Beaker & Apparatus* – Visual representation of titration setup.  
✔ *Dynamic Color Change* – Beaker color changes based on chloride concentration.  
✔ *Real-Time Calculations* – Computes chloride concentration in mol/L and ppm.  
✔ *Interactive Experiment* – Click to add AgNO₃ and observe titration in action.  
✔ *Scoring System* – Earn points for each titration step.  
✔ *Reset Experiment* – Restart the simulation anytime.
